             <p class="dark">A secondary school is both an organization that delivers education and the building where this takes place. A secondary school can deliver level two junior secondary education, level 3 (upper) secondary education phases of the ISCED scale or both. Level 2 junior secondary education is considered to be the second and final phase of basic education. Secondary schools typically follow on from primary schools and lead into vocational and tertiary education. Attendance is compulsory in most countries for students between the ages 13 and 16. The organisations, buildings and terminology remain unique to each country.</p>
